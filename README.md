# Bloodlines - A custom character importer for Vampire Survivors
A mod for Vampire Survivors to help facilitate creating custom characters.

## Install
1. Install MelonLoader
2. Download dll from newest release
3. Add to the mods folder in Vampire Survivors
4. Run Vampire Survivors and the mod will create the required directories.

## Adding a character
Custom characters can be added to the game being downloading and copying a zip file to the Bloodlines directory ("Vampire Survivors/UserData/Bloodlines") once the game starts, the character will be imported and the zip file will be deleted.

## Creating your own characters
**TODO:** More info needed

Zip files are used to import characters into the game.
The zip files contain two things:
1. character.json
 - This is a json document that holds all the info on the character. Name, starting weapon, strength, etc. Currently it mimics the Vampire Survivors character json data.
2. png files
 - The sprite(s) you want to use for the character. The json document must reference them.


## Json Schema
**TODO:** Need a wiki/readme for this.

## Sharing skins
**TODO:** Make a discord for this or something.
